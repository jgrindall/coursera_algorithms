usage
=====

command line - npm i, node main

1. It takes a list of folders from the folder "files", processes them and creates zips that you can upload to PM in the "gen" folder.

2. It processes them and saves (in the same locations, same file name but .2diy replaced with .2quiz)

3. Currently supports
	* grouping (12 into 2 boxes ONLY)
	* labelling
	* mcq
	* pairs
	* puzzle

It should work for "Levels" but that hasn't been tested much
